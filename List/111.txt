**List slicing in Python** is a powerful technique that allows you to extract specific portions of a list. 
It's commonly used by programmers to efficiently manipulate lists. 

1. **Positive Indexing**:
   - In positive indexing, the first element of the list has index 0, 
   and the last element has index N-1 (where N is the total number of elements in the list).
   - To slice a list, use the format: `Lst[Initial:End:IndexJump]`.
   - For example, if `Lst` is a list, `Lst[1:5]` returns a new list containing elements from index 1 to 4 (i.e., `[70, 30, 20, 90]`).

2. **Negative Indexing**:
   - Negative indexing starts from the end of the list. Index -1 represents the last element, -2 represents the second-to-last, and so on.
   - To slice using negative indexes, use `Lst[-7::1]`, which gives you the entire list.

3. **Examples**:
   - Leaving any argument (Initial, End, or IndexJump) blank uses default values: 0 as Initial, length of the list as End, and 1 as IndexJump.
   - Example with a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`:
     - `List[3:9:2]` returns `[4, 6, 8]`.
     - `List[::2]` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
     - `List[::]` returns the entire list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.



     
**List** and **Tuple** are both Python data structures, but they have distinct characteristics. 

1. **Mutability**:
   - **List**: Lists are **mutable**, meaning you can modify their elements after creation. You can add, remove, or change items in a list.
   - **Tuple**: Tuples are **immutable**, which means once created, their elements cannot be altered.
   Tuples provide stability and prevent accidental changes.

2. **Performance**:
   - **List**: Lists are better for operations like insertion and deletion due to their mutability. 
   However, iterating through lists can be time-consuming.
   - **Tuple**: Tuples are faster during iteration because of their immutability. 
   If you need to access elements frequently without modification, tuples are more efficient.

3. **Memory Usage**:
   - **List**: Lists consume more memory than tuples. They have additional overhead for dynamic resizing and maintaining mutability.
   - **Tuple**: Tuples are memory-efficient because they are stored in a single memory block. They don't require extra space for new objects.

4. **Built-in Methods**:
   - **List**: Lists have several built-in methods for manipulation, such as `append`, `extend`, and `pop`.
   - **Tuple**: Tuples have fewer built-in methods compared to lists. They mainly support methods like `count` and `index`.

In summary, use lists when you need flexibility and modification, and use tuples when stability and memory efficiency are crucial.
