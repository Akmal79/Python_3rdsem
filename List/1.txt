Imagine you have a box of Legos (your list).
List comprehension is like a magic machine that builds a new box of Legos based on the first one.
You tell the machine what to do to each Lego (like squaring a number).
You can also tell it which Legos to pick (like only choosing even ones).
All in one quick step, you get a brand new box of Legos (your new list)!
